# Soundness composition — CONDITIONAL, not finished SNARK soundness

**Status.** This is a *conditional composition*, not finished SNARK soundness, and it does not yet share
a formal object with the fingerprint MSM (§1). It is named with a `_conditional` suffix to avoid
overclaiming. (The deployed soundness is carried further in `Zcash.Snark.Weld` — the AGM opening, the
multiopen decode, and the derived constraint — closing these gaps to the named floor.) The gaps here:

* `accepts` is an opaque `Prop`; it is **not** instantiated to the deployed accept condition
  `(assemble vk ps ch).eval … = 0`, so the theorem says nothing about the fingerprint (the opening side).
* `ExtractableFromAcceptance` assumes the **IPA knowledge-soundness conclusion** (a consistent transcript
  tree + a valid opening) — i.e. it bundles Fiat–Shamir *and* the extraction that `accepting_fold_eq` /
  `extract_correct` were meant to prove, so those proven lemmas are **off this path**.
* `SnarkRelation` now ties both conjuncts to the *same* witness `a` (opens `P` **and** `circuitSat a`);
  but `circuitSat a` is currently supplied by `ExtractableFromAcceptance` (assumed), not
  *derived* from the deployed constraint check via `constraint_identity_of_accept` and the multiopen
  decode (the constraint side, open).
* `hbind` (DLR hardness) is passed to `knowledge_sound` but only feeds its uniqueness conjunct, which this
  proof discards — so binding is currently inert on the path to `S`.

What *is* proven lives in the component lemmas (`extract_correct`, `accepting_fold_eq`, `commitGen_round`,
`quotientCheck_sound`, `ipaRelation_unique`, the binding reduction, `eval_combineGates`); the open work is
wiring them onto this path. `Zcash.Snark.Vesta` instantiates this conditional theorem at the concrete
Vesta curve. See `Zcash.Snark.KnowledgeSoundness` for the assumption list.

/-- **Assumed: acceptance yields the IPA extraction data** (stronger than "just Fiat–Shamir"). Given
`accepts`, this hands over a consistent transcript tree and a valid opening — i.e. it assumes the IPA
knowledge-soundness *conclusion* that `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` were meant to produce,
bundled with Fiat–Shamir. Honest reading: "assume IPA knowledge soundness + FS," not "hand-wave only FS."
Splitting this into the genuine FS step (`accept → ∃ tree`) and the proven extraction — so the residual
assumption narrows to "challenges are uniform and unpredictable" — is open work on the constraint side. It now
also bundles `circuitSat a` (the extracted witness satisfies the circuit); deriving that from the deployed
constraint check rather than assuming it is likewise open. -/

-- TODO(semantic adequacy): `hencodes`/`S` below are the seam from circuit-satisfiability to the
-- high-level Orchard relation. Currently `S` is a free `Prop` and `hencodes` is an assumed hypothesis, so
-- the chain stops at "the extracted witness satisfies the gates" (`SnarkRelation`) and never reaches
-- "…therefore a valid Orchard action" (note well-formed, value balances, nullifier correctly derived,
-- spend authorized). Closing it: instantiate `S` to the concrete Orchard statement and *prove* `hencodes`.
-- The soundness composition reaches only `SnarkRelation`; this is the output-side dual of the
-- input-side VK-correctness gap (see `Assemble.lean`). Large; not started.
/-- **Conditional soundness composition (NOT completed soundness).** From the *assumed* extraction data
(`hextract haccepts` — which now also yields `circuitSat a`), conclude `S` via `hencodes`.

This assumes what §2 should prove: `accepts` is opaque (the `_deployed` variant fixes that); the
extraction + circuit-satisfaction are assumed (so `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` /
`constraint_identity_of_accept` are off-path); and `hbind`'s binding only feeds the discarded uniqueness
conjunct. It is the scaffold for the composition, not the composition — see the module docstring (and
`Zcash.Snark.Weld` for the deployed closures). -/

`DeployedAccepts` — so §1's `assemble` / `Msm.eval` and the §2 soundness theorem finally share a formal
object (previously `accepts` was a free `Prop`).

Still conditional: the bridge `hextract : DeployedAccepts … → ∃ t a, Consistent t a ∧ IpaRelation …`
is **assumed**. Proving it — `(assemble vk ps ch).eval srs = 0 → ∃ t a, Consistent t a ∧ IpaRelation …`
— is the hard remaining seam (the full opening derivation), the actual IPA/multiopen soundness connecting
the assembled MSM to the opening. -/

/-- **Soundness from an accepting IPA transcript — the extraction now PROVEN, not assumed.** Given an
accepting witness tree over the SRS generators (`haccept`; the per-node binding/DLR hardness lives inside
`Accepting`), the root response opening the commitment (`hopen`), and its circuit-satisfaction (`hsat`),
the **extracted** witness `extract wt.toTree` satisfies `SnarkRelation`, hence `S`.

This is the payoff of the constraint-side work: `accepting_extract` (the IPA extraction,
`accepting_imp_wconsistent` + `extract_correct`) is **on the path** — the conclusion is about the
*extracted* witness, so the extractor genuinely contributes (unlike `orchard_verifier_sound_conditional`,
where it was discarded). The residual assumption is now only the **structural**
`accept → ∃ Accepting tree` (the multiopen decode) together with the response's opening (`hopen`) and
circuit-satisfaction (`hsat` — itself dischargeable by `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`). -/

/-! ## `IpaRelation` is derived from the transcript tree, not assumed

`Zcash.Snark.ipa_soundV` derives the *full* opening relation — `commit g a = P` **and** `⟨a,b⟩ = v` — from
an accepting IPA transcript tree (`IpaAcceptV`), binding-free, by 3-special soundness. So the bridge no
longer *assumes* `IpaRelation`. Honest caveat: the tree-bridge (`FiatShamirTree`) is **not**
purely the rewinding — it also absorbs (i) the MSM↔tree structural correspondence (that `assemble.eval = 0`
unfolds into the recursive checks for the proof's actual `P,b,v,L,R`), which is *provable* via
`eval_assembleFinalMsm` but not yet wired, and (ii) the pinning of free `P,b,v` to the proof.
The cryptographic opening is genuinely derived; the residual bundle is structural/mechanical. -/

/-- `IpaAcceptV` over the SRS generators derives the existing `IpaRelation`: the witness `ipa_soundV`
extracts opens `P` (`commit srs a = commitGen srs.g a`) and gives the inner product
(`commitGen b a = ⟨a,b⟩`). The IPA opening is now *derived*, not assumed. -/

/-- **The transcript-tree bridge — SUPERSEDED by `Zcash.Snark.DeployedIpaRewind`.** Acceptance yields a
*clean* `IpaAcceptV` tree. This absorbed two things beyond the rewinding: (i) the MSM↔tree structural
correspondence and (ii) the `U`/`W`/`S` separation (since `IpaAcceptV` is the blinding-free IPA). Of these,
(ii) is now genuinely *proven and on-path* (`Zcash.Snark.deployed_ipa_soundV`), and the flat half of (i) is
proven (`foldAll = G'₀`, `compute_b = ⟨sFun, evalVector⟩`; `deployed_verification_eq`). `DeployedIpaRewind`
(`Zcash.Snark.Weld`) is the replacement bridge — but it is **not yet** pure rewinding: it still bundles the
MSM↔tree correspondence (the proven flat fact is a sidecar, not composed in — see its docstring). Prefer the
capstones `orchard_verifier_sound_deployed_full`/`_pinned`/`_closed` over the `_opening`/`_constraint` theorems that use
this, but read their honest residual notes. -/

/-- **The deployed Orchard verifier is sound — opening derived.** From the deployed accept
(`assemble.eval = 0`), the minimal Fiat–Shamir bridge `hFS` (acceptance yields the transcript tree —
the *only* IPA assumption), and the circuit-satisfaction of the opening (`hcirc`, the constraint side,
dischargeable by `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`), conclude `S`.

The IPA opening (`IpaRelation`) is **derived** here via `ipaRelation_of_acceptV`/`ipa_soundV` — it is no
longer assumed (the earlier conditional bridges that bundled it have been removed). Honest scope:
`hFS` still absorbs the MSM↔tree correspondence + `P,b,v` pinning (see `FiatShamirTree`), and
`hcirc` is the assumed constraint side — `orchard_verifier_sound_deployed_constraint` derives it from the gate check.
Superseded by `orchard_verifier_sound_deployed_full`/`_closed` (`Zcash.Snark.Weld`), which peel `U`/`W`/`S`
and wire the multiopen decode; prefer those.
Named assumptions: the bridge (`hFS`), the constraint side (`hcirc`), DLR hardness (for *uniqueness*,
unused on this path), and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). -/

/-! ## `circuitSat` is derived from the verifier's gate check + Schwartz–Zippel

The constraint side mirrors the opening side. The verifier checks the gate identity only at the challenge `x` — a *point*
check (`quotientCheck`, `numerator.eval x = h.eval x · (xⁿ−1)`). `circuitSatViaGates_of_check` lifts that
point check to the polynomial identity `circuitSatViaGates` (the witness's decoded columns satisfy the
gates) provided `x` avoids the Schwartz–Zippel bad set (`hgood`). So `circuitSat`, instantiated to the
concrete `circuitSatViaGates`, is *derived* from the verifier's actual gate check — no black-box `hcirc`. -/

open Polynomial in
/-- **The deployed Orchard verifier is sound — opening and constraint both derived.** Both conjuncts of
`SnarkRelation` are *derived*, not assumed: `IpaRelation` (the opening) from the transcript tree via
`ipa_soundV`; and `circuitSat` — instantiated to `circuitSatViaGates` — from the verifier's quotient/gate
**point** check `hquot` at the challenge `x`, lifted to the polynomial identity by Schwartz–Zippel
(`hgood`), via `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`.

The black-box `hcirc` is gone. What remains are the verifier's actual checks and the standard assumptions:
the special-soundness rewinding tree (`hFS`), the gate point-check (`hquot`), the SZ good challenge
(`hgood`), and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). `hquot`/`hgood` are the constraint-side analog of `hFS` — the
gate check is part of `assemble.eval = 0` modulo the multiopen decode that ties the opened columns to it. -/
