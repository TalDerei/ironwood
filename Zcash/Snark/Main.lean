# Soundness composition — CONDITIONAL, not yet completed (§2, in progress)

**Status.** This is a *conditional composition*, not finished SNARK soundness, and it does not yet share
a formal object with the fingerprint MSM (§1). It is named with a `_conditional` suffix to avoid
overclaiming. The gaps (tracked in `notes/fv-review-checklist.md`):

* `accepts` is an opaque `Prop`; it is **not** instantiated to the deployed accept condition
  `(assemble vk ps ch).eval … = 0`, so the theorem says nothing about the fingerprint (checklist C1).
* `ExtractableFromAcceptance` assumes the **IPA knowledge-soundness conclusion** (a consistent transcript
  tree + a valid opening) — i.e. it bundles Fiat–Shamir *and* the extraction that `accepting_fold_eq` /
  `extract_correct` were meant to prove, so those proven lemmas are **off this path** (C3).
* `SnarkRelation` now ties both conjuncts to the *same* witness `a` (opens `P` **and** `circuitSat a`) —
  C2 done; but `circuitSat a` is currently supplied by `ExtractableFromAcceptance` (assumed), not
  *derived* from the deployed constraint check via `constraint_identity_of_accept` and the multiopen
  decode (C3, open).
* `hbind` (DLR hardness) is passed to `knowledge_sound` but only feeds its uniqueness conjunct, which this
  proof discards — so binding is currently inert on the path to `S`.

What *is* proven lives in the component lemmas (`extract_correct`, `accepting_fold_eq`, `commitGen_round`,
`quotientCheck_sound`, `ipaRelation_unique`, the binding reduction, `eval_combineGates`); the open work is
wiring them onto this path. `Zcash.Snark.Vesta` instantiates this conditional theorem at the concrete
Vesta curve. See `Zcash.Snark.KnowledgeSoundness` for the assumption list.

/-- **Assumed: acceptance yields the IPA extraction data** (stronger than "just Fiat–Shamir"). Given
`accepts`, this hands over a consistent transcript tree and a valid opening — i.e. it assumes the IPA
knowledge-soundness *conclusion* that `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` were meant to produce,
bundled with Fiat–Shamir. Honest reading: "assume IPA knowledge soundness + FS," not "hand-wave only FS."
Splitting this into the genuine FS step (`accept → ∃ tree`) and the proven extraction — so the residual
assumption narrows to "challenges are uniform and unpredictable" — is open §2 work (checklist C3). It now
also bundles `circuitSat a` (the extracted witness satisfies the circuit); deriving that from the deployed
constraint check rather than assuming it is likewise open (C3). -/

-- TODO(Step 4 / semantic adequacy): `hencodes`/`S` below are the seam from circuit-satisfiability to the
-- high-level Orchard relation. Currently `S` is a free `Prop` and `hencodes` is an assumed hypothesis, so
-- the chain stops at "the extracted witness satisfies the gates" (`SnarkRelation`) and never reaches
-- "…therefore a valid Orchard action" (note well-formed, value balances, nullifier correctly derived,
-- spend authorized). Closing it: instantiate `S` to the concrete Orchard statement and *prove* `hencodes`.
-- Beyond §2 (C1–C3 only reach `SnarkRelation`); the output-side dual of the input-side VK-correctness gap
-- (see `Assemble.lean`). Large; not started.
/-- **Conditional soundness composition (NOT completed soundness).** From the *assumed* extraction data
(`hextract haccepts` — which now also yields `circuitSat a`), conclude `S` via `hencodes`.

This assumes what §2 should prove: `accepts` is opaque (the `_deployed` variant fixes that); the
extraction + circuit-satisfaction are assumed (so `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` /
`constraint_identity_of_accept` are off-path); and `hbind`'s binding only feeds the discarded uniqueness
conjunct. It is the scaffold for the composition, not the composition — see the module docstring and
`notes/fv-review-checklist.md`. -/

Still conditional: the bridge `hextract : DeployedAccepts … → ∃ t a, Consistent t a ∧ IpaRelation …`
is **assumed**. Proving it — `(assemble vk ps ch).eval srs = 0 → ∃ t a, Consistent t a ∧ IpaRelation …`

MSM to the opening. -/

accepting witness tree over the SRS generators (`haccept`; the per-node binding/DLR hardness lives inside
`Accepting`), the root response opening the commitment (`hopen`), and its circuit-satisfaction (`hsat`),
the **extracted** witness `extract wt.toTree` satisfies `SnarkRelation`, hence `S`.

This is the payoff of the C3 work: `accepting_extract` (the IPA extraction, `accepting_imp_wconsistent` +
`extract_correct`) is **on the path** — the conclusion is about the *extracted* witness, so the extractor
genuinely contributes (unlike `orchard_verifier_sound_conditional`, where it was discarded). The residual
assumption is now only the **structural** `accept → ∃ Accepting tree` (the multiopen decode, checklist
C1-full) together with the response's opening (`hopen`) and circuit-satisfaction (`hsat` — itself
dischargeable by `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`). -/

/-- **The extraction bridge from deployed acceptance — bundles THREE assumptions (not "minimal FS").** A
deployed accepting proof yields a witness tree that is `Accepting` (the rewinding/forking step — genuine
Fiat–Shamir), **and** whose root response opens the commitment (`IpaRelation`), **and** satisfies the
circuit (`circuitSat`).

The latter two conjuncts are **assumed here, not derived.** `Accepting srs.g wt` is defined over `srs.g`
and the tree's internal fold-consistency *only* — it never mentions `P`, `b`, `v` — so it cannot imply
`IpaRelation srs P b v wt.witness`; circuit-satisfaction is likewise separate. Deriving them from deployed
acceptance is the open C1 work: `Zcash.Snark.eval_ipaFold` (the IPA verification equation) is the lever for
the opening, `circuitSatViaGates_of_check` for the constraint. Until those land and these conjuncts are
removed, the IPA knowledge-soundness conclusion + the constraint are part of the assumption, not proven. -/

/-- **The deployed Orchard verifier is sound — CONDITIONAL on the extraction bridge.** From the deployed
accept condition (`haccepts : DeployedAccepts`, i.e. `assemble.eval srs = 0`) and the bridge `hbridge`, plus
the VK encoding the statement (`hencodes`), conclude the high-level statement `S`.

**Conditional, and `hbridge` bundles unproven content.** `ExtractableFromDeployedAccept` assumes the
rewinding (genuine FS) **and** the IPA opening (`IpaRelation`) **and** circuit-satisfaction — and the latter
two are *not* derived from `DeployedAccepts` here (its content is only the trigger fed to `hbridge`; the MSM
equation is never inspected). What *is* proven on the path: rewinding's `Accepting` tree extracts the
witness (`accepting_extract`), so the conclusion is about the *extracted* witness. **Genuinely closing C1**
means deriving `IpaRelation` and `circuitSat` from `DeployedAccepts` (via `eval_ipaFold` and
`circuitSatViaGates_of_check`) and *removing* those conjuncts from the bridge — open work; until then this
is the honest conditional form. -/

/-! ## C1 closed: `IpaRelation` is derived from the transcript tree, not assumed

`Zcash.Snark.ipa_soundV` derives the *full* opening relation — `commit g a = P` **and** `⟨a,b⟩ = v` — from
an accepting IPA transcript tree (`IpaAcceptV`), binding-free, by 3-special soundness. So the bridge no
longer needs to *assume* `IpaRelation`: it only needs to supply the accepting **tree** (the genuine
Fiat–Shamir/special-soundness rewinding — `accept → ∃ tree`), which is the irreducible standard-model
assumption and nothing more. This removes the `IpaRelation` conjunct from the bridge (review item C1). -/

/-- `IpaAcceptV` over the SRS generators derives the existing `IpaRelation`: the witness `ipa_soundV`
extracts opens `P` (`commit srs a = commitGen srs.g a`) and gives the inner product
(`commitGen b a = ⟨a,b⟩`). The IPA opening is now *derived*, not assumed. -/

/-- **The minimal Fiat–Shamir bridge: just the accepting transcript tree.** Unlike
`ExtractableFromDeployedAccept`, this assumes *only* that acceptance yields an `IpaAcceptV` tree — the
special-soundness rewinding — and nothing about `IpaRelation` (which `ipa_soundV` derives). This is the
irreducible standard-model assumption, isolated. -/

/-- **The deployed Orchard verifier is sound — C1 closed.** From the deployed accept
(`assemble.eval = 0`), the minimal Fiat–Shamir bridge `hFS` (acceptance yields the transcript tree —
the *only* IPA assumption), and the circuit-satisfaction of the opening (`hcirc`, the constraint side /
checklist C3, dischargeable by `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`), conclude `S`.

The IPA opening (`IpaRelation`) is **derived** here via `ipaRelation_of_acceptV`/`ipa_soundV` — it is no
longer assumed (contrast `orchard_verifier_sound_deployed_final`, whose bridge bundled it). What the bridge
supplies is exactly the special-soundness rewinding (`accept → ∃ tree`); everything from the tree to
`IpaRelation` is proven, binding-free. The remaining named assumptions are the standard ones: the rewinding
(`hFS`), the circuit/constraint side (`hcirc`, C3), DLR hardness (for *uniqueness*, unused on this path),
and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). -/

/-! ## C3 closed: `circuitSat` is derived from the verifier's gate check + Schwartz–Zippel

The constraint side mirrors C1. The verifier checks the gate identity only at the challenge `x` — a *point*
check (`quotientCheck`, `numerator.eval x = h.eval x · (xⁿ−1)`). `circuitSatViaGates_of_check` lifts that
point check to the polynomial identity `circuitSatViaGates` (the witness's decoded columns satisfy the
gates) provided `x` avoids the Schwartz–Zippel bad set (`hgood`). So `circuitSat`, instantiated to the
concrete `circuitSatViaGates`, is *derived* from the verifier's actual gate check — no black-box `hcirc`. -/

/-- **The deployed Orchard verifier is sound — C1 and C3 closed.** Both conjuncts of `SnarkRelation` are
*derived*, not assumed: `IpaRelation` (the opening) from the transcript tree via `ipa_soundV` (C1); and
`circuitSat` — instantiated to `circuitSatViaGates` — from the verifier's quotient/gate **point** check
`hquot` at the challenge `x`, lifted to the polynomial identity by Schwartz–Zippel (`hgood`), via
`circuitSatViaGates_of_check` (C3).

The black-box `hcirc` is gone. What remains are the verifier's actual checks and the standard assumptions:
the special-soundness rewinding tree (`hFS`), the gate point-check (`hquot`), the SZ good challenge
(`hgood`), and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). `hquot`/`hgood` are the constraint-side analog of `hFS` — the
gate check is part of `assemble.eval = 0` modulo the multiopen decode that ties the opened columns to it. -/
